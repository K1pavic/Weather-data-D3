# Weather-data-D3

A website for data visualization made with d3 and java script. The visualization is about some weather statistics for 5 cities in the UK.

The web page uses bootstrap for responsivnes (the graphs aren't responsive) and the d3 java script library for creating the graphs displayed. The functions that navigate trough the buttons are made in javascript.

To run the web page just run index.html in your browser (because of bootstrap and the d3 library you have to be connected to the internet).
